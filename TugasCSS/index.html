		<h2>Bounty Hunter's Guild</h2>
		<p>Bounty hunters are people who make a living out of catching criminals for the bounty on their head. Unlike mercenaries or assassins, who are hired or commissioned by the government to hunt down criminals, bounty hunters and bounty hunter groups operate completely independently, working outside the law to capture criminals. It is typically common practice to capture criminals alive rather than kill them, that you could lose up to 30% of the bounty if you killed your target. While most bounty hunters operate for money, some seek the fame that results from taking down infamous criminals.</p>

				<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
				<p >The Bounty Hunters' Guild (BHG), also known as the Bondsman's Guild or simply the Bounty Guild, was an institution that regulated the complicated profession that was the bounty-hunting trade throughout the galaxy.Ensuring the legality of hunting for its members, it worked alongside galactic governments and curated bounties for its members. From the Republic Era to the New Republic Era, the Guild operated with members of various species and droid models, both with loyal and independent programming, and had a Code that hunters were mandated to stand by. During the Galactic Civil War and into the time of the New Republic, the Bounty Hunters' Guild had close ties to the Galactic Empire and its remnants, although it turned to favor the Resistance during the Cold War due to the First Order's reluctance to deal business with its hunters.</p>
